- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mr-telli
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in doing stuffs that I like on my own pace.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and AutoIt and Excel VBA.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email @ martelli@outlook.ph

Notes to myself (and maybe to you also):
- Some of my repositories are hidden due to some private projects that I am doing and some are from the CS50P that I am taking.
- So, the only one I am going to show publicly is my AutoIt projects (not work related tho) for my videos.
